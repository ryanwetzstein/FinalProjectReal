                <h3>How do I adopt a dog from your organization?</h3>
                <p>The first step is to complete an adoption application, which helps us understand your home environment and your ability to care for a new dog.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>How can I view the available dogs for adoption?</h3>
                <p>You can browse our available dogs online or visit us in person to meet them.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>Do I need to pay an adoption fee?</h3>
                <p>Yes, there is an adoption fee, which helps cover the cost of veterinary care, vaccinations, and other essential services.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>What does the adoption fee include?</h3>
                <p>The adoption fee helps us with the background check as well as the time we take reviewing the application</p>
                <br />

                <h3>How long does the adoption process take?</h3>
                <p>The process usually takes a few days to a week, depending on application review and scheduling a meet-and-greet with the dog.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>Can I meet the dog before adopting?</h3>
                <p>Yes, we encourage meet-and-greets to ensure you and the dog are a good match.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>What if I am not sure which dog is right for me?</h3>
                <p>Our team is happy to assist you in choosing a dog based on your lifestyle, preferences, and living situation.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>Are the dogs spayed or neutered?</h3>
                <p>The dogs come from different backgrounds, so not dogs are spayed or neutered before adoption.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>What if I already have other pets at home?</h3>
                <p>We have a policy on recent adoption history so it is unlikely if you've adopted one within a year. However if you have had enough time between adoptions, we recommend doing a trial introduction to see how the new dog interacts with your current pets.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>What if I need to return the dog?</h3>
                <p>If for any reason the adoption is not working out, we have a return policy to ensure the dog’s well-being.</p>
                <br />

                <h3>Can I adopt a dog if I live in an apartment or rental property?</h3>
                <p>Yes, but please ensure you have permission from your landlord or property management if required.</p>
