            <h3>Adoption Policy</h3>
            <p>At <strong>Doggy Domain</strong>, we believe that every dog deserves a loving home, and we are committed to ensuring that our adopted dogs go to responsible and caring families. To ensure the best match between our dogs and adopters, we have established the following adoption policy:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adoption Application</strong>: All prospective adopters must complete an adoption application. This helps us understand your home environment and how you plan to care for your new dog.</li>
                <li><strong>Age Requirement</strong>: Adopters must be at least 18 years of age to ensure responsibility and commitment to the dog's care.</li>
                <li><strong>Address Requirement</strong>: We require a valid address to help us ensure proper record-keeping for the adoption process.</li>
                <li><strong>Criminal Record Check</strong>: Individuals with a criminal record are not eligible to adopt a dog to ensure the safety and welfare of our animals.</li>
                <li><strong>Previous Adoptions</strong>: Adopters who have adopted another animal from this or another shelter within the last 12 months are not eligible to adopt at this time.</li>
                <li><strong>Income Requirement</strong>: Adopters must have an annual income of at least $15,708 to demonstrate the financial ability to provide for the dog's needs.</li>
                <li><strong>Adoption Fee</strong>: Adopters will spend $250 to allow the Doggy Domain to run.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We appreciate your interest in adopting and offering a forever home to one of our wonderful dogs. Your love and care make all the difference!</p>
