        Luna is a 4-year-old Great Dane with a heart as big as her paws. Despite her size, she’s a gentle and affectionate companion who thrives on human interaction.

        She loves long naps, short walks, and lounging on the couch with her favorite humans. Luna is great with kids and other dogs, making her the perfect addition to a loving family.
